In this script we will implement our MSE and Cross Entropy loss functions, including both the forward and backward processes.
More details about customizing a backward process can be found in:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_autograd/two_layer_net_custom_function.html

        loss = torch.sum((pred - label) ** 2)
        ctx.save_for_backward(pred, label)

        return loss

    However, when z_i has a lager value, exp(z_i) might become infinity.
    So we use stable softmax:
        softmax(z_i) = A exp(z_i) / A (exp(z_0) + exp(z_1) + ...)
    where
        A = exp(-z_max) = exp(-max{z_0, z_1, ...})
